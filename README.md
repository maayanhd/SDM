App in 3 levels - console -> JAVAFX -> Cliend-Server

First level - Consol application consists of an e-commerce system- specifically in the food supermarket area - functionality provided by console api.
The 2 latter levels - yet to be completed- potentially will be built next summer on top of a different java console application idea.
